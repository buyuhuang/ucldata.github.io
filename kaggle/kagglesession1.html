      <p>Welcome to our first project group session!</p>
      <p>The project group is created for students who already have some programming experience in R or Python.</p>
      <p>We are hoping to hold this regular event so that students with such backgrounds can work together to solve
        real-world data science problems, and compete globally with others.</p>
      <p>
        In this first session we will be going over a few data science neccessities, such as the importance of
              uploading code on GitHub, how to submit a competition entry on the website Kaggle, and some supervised
              learning tips. Then, everyone will be given the opportunity to work in teams and play around with the
              popular Titanic dataset, in order to best predict whether or not a passenger survived based on their
              demographics and ticket status.

        <p>Welcome to the Data Science Curriculum - UCL's student-led machine learning workshop series. Throughout the academic year, we'll bring you 8 fully fledged, 2-hour workshops sessions where you'll learn everything from coding in R or Python, statistical thinking, and advanced machine learning algorithms.</p>
        <p>
          In this workshop we're going to provide you with an introduction to programming in Python for data science.
          This workshop will differ significantly from other introductory courses to programing, and will focus
          on the use of packages such as NumPy, Pandas and SciKit; so even programmers with experience may benefit
          from the workshop.
